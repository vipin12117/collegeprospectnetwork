2.  Bug: Unable to Assign School/Team to Player
I am still trying to move forward with the testing of this player so that I can verify the
Athlete Approval process, but I can't change the school/team for this player
"december23athlete". This is critical because players move schools and change AAU
teams often, so we need to be able to update the database to reflect that. On a related
note, where is the list below coming from? There does not appear to be any sort of
rhyme or reason to how these schools appear in the menu.
